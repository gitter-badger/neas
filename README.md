# NEAS
The .NET Embedded Application Server aims to provide easy application development for headless embedded systems entirely written in C#. The idea is to make
hardware near application development as easy and flexible as modern client-server appliations on IIS or tomcat while maintaining minimum hardware
requirements and offering maximum performance.

## Code generation
One of the main ideas of NEAS is to use code generation where other frameworks use reflection.
